# nanonispy

A small library written in python 3 to parse Nanonis binary and ascii files. 

## Requirements

Currently written and 'tested' with python 3.5, fairly sure this won't work with version of python < 3.0

- numpy (>1.10)

Will continue making tests that are actually useful and maybe will make this a conda/pip build.
